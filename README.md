# Linear Regression Using Python Libraries

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Linear Regression model
using Python machine learning libraries. The goal is to understand the
complete workflow of a machine learning project — from data loading to
model evaluation.

## Project Overview
Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to
predict continuous values based on input features. In this project,
a regression model is trained on a dataset to predict outcomes and
evaluate model performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
1. Imported required libraries
2. Loaded the dataset
3. Performed data preprocessing
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained Linear Regression model using scikit-learn
6. Made predictions on test data
7. Evaluated model performance
8. Visualized results

## Model Used
- Linear Regression (sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anshika135/Implementation-of-Linear-Regression-using-Python
